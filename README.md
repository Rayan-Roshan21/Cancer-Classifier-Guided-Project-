**Breast Cancer Classifier**

This project, guided by Codecademy, focuses on implementing a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to predict breast cancer diagnoses based on a dataset from the scikit-learn library. While the project provides guidance, I coded the solution, refining my understanding of machine learning and classification models.

**Context**

Breast cancer diagnosis is a critical application of machine learning in healthcare. This project uses the KNN algorithm to analyze and classify breast cancer data, highlighting the importance of hyperparameter tuning (K values) in optimizing model performance.

**Highlights**

**Dataset:**
The project utilizes scikit-learn's Breast Cancer dataset, which contains features related to cell nuclei and binary target labels (malignant or benign).

**Model Training and Evaluation:**

- Split the data into training and validation sets.
- Implemented the KNN classifier for various values of K (neighbors).
- Evaluated model accuracy using validation data.

**Visualization:**

Generated a plot to visualize the relationship between K values and validation accuracy, identifying the optimal K for performance.

**Tools and Libraries**
- Python for implementation
- scikit-learn for dataset and KNN model
- Matplotlib for plotting accuracy trends

**Takeaways**

This project emphasizes the balance between model simplicity and accuracy. The ability to adjust hyperparameters like K plays a crucial role in achieving reliable predictions.
